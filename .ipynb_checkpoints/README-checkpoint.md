## Overview
This repository was created with the aims to find the 'best' neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. Our metric to decide the 'best' was jaywalking, or in other words we wanted to find the easiest place to jaywalk. Using traffic data alongside urban planning features, we gave each neighborhood points to gauge how easily one could cross a random street.

### [City of Pittsburgh Trafic Count](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh)
"This traffic-count data is provided by the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility & Infrastructure (DOMI). Counters were deployed as part of traffic studies, including intersection studies, and studies covering where or whether to install speed humps. In some cases, data may have been collected by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC) or BikePGH.

Data is currently available for only the most-recent count at each location.

Traffic count data is important to the process for deciding where to install speed humps. According to DOMI, they may only be legally installed on streets where traffic counts fall below a minimum threshhold. Residents can request an evaluation of their street as part of DOMI's Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program. The City has also shared data on the impact of the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program in reducing speeds.

Different studies may collect different data. Speed hump studies capture counts and speeds. SPC and BikePGH conduct counts of cyclists. Intersection studies included in this dataset may not include traffic counts, but reports of individual studies may be requested from the City. Despite the lack of count data, intersection studies are included to facilitate data requests.

Data captured by different types of counting devices are included in this data. StatTrak counters are in use by the City, and capture data on counts and speeds. More information about these devices may be found on the company's website. Data includes traffic counts and average speeds, and may also include separate counts of bicycles.

Tubes are deployed by both SPC and BikePGH and used to count cyclists. SPC may also deploy video counters to collect data.
